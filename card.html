			<p>The domestic dog is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>
			<ul class="animalDescription">
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Canis familiaris</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 57 centimeters</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 10 years</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: House</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the sobriquet, "man's best friend".</p>
